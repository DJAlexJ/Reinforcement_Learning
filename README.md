# Reinforcement_Learning
Implementations of 3 basic algorithms:
    1. Reinforce with n trajectories
    2. Advantage Actor Critic
    3. Reinforce with Baseline (b(s) - function minimizing varince of gradient vector)
    
df_reinforce contains all the rewards and smoothed rewards over 10 episodes during learning reinforce
df_reinforce_baseline contains all the rewards and smoothed rewards over 10 episodes during reinforce with baseline

Notebook 'Visualizations' includes useful charts for comparison
